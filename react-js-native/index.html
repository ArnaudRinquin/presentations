      # The rendering cycle in react

      Anatomy of a React component:

      * `render`, a function that kind of work as a template
      * `props`, data passed from parent component
      * `state`, the component internal, non leaky, data

      --

      `subtree DOM = render(props + state)`

      ---

      # The rendering cycle in react

      **There is no DOM mutation**, the **whole** app is re-rendered every time some component `state` changes.

      --

      > mrgmrglb performances?! you craaaazy?!

      --

      > JS is fast, DOM is slow.

      --

      React does it well:

      1. generate a `virtual-DOM`,
      1. diff it with previous `virtual-DOM`,
      1. generate a list of minimal actual DOM changes,
      1. Apply the changes

      ---

      But a component is not just JS.

      --

      Right?

      --

      It also comes with markup (HTML) and style (CSS).

      --

      Right?

      --

      So we just put everything in the same file. JS, ~HTML~ and ~CSS~.

      OK, all right, that's not your usual javascript file.

      --

      It's ES6 + JSX

      You'll get used to it super quickly and will never want to come back.

      ---

      # Inter component communication

      * Parent > child : props
      * Child > parent: functions passed as props

      ---

      # Smart / dumb component principle

      Smart components

      * contain the logic to fetch data and apply actions
      * usually have a `state`
      * can nest both other smart components or dumb

      Dumb components

      * pure rendering logic based on props
      * only nest other dumb components

      ---

      # React Native

      Exact same principles as React web

      * components work exactly the same
      * Javascript running live (not compiled to Objective-C)

      --

      but:

      * the js file either come from the compiled bundle or... any URL
      * the target is now native components instead of the DOM
      * replace `div` with `View` and span with `Text`

      That's it.

      ---

      ```jsx
      import React, {View, Text, TouchableHighlight} from 'react-native';

      class Counter extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
          super();
          this.state = {
            counter: 0
          };
        }

        render(){
          return (
            <View style={[ styles.background, styles.bottomBarMargin ]} >
              <Text>{this.state.counter}</Text>
              <TouchableHighlight onPress={this.increment}>
                <Text>Press me!</Text>
              </TouchableHighlight>
            </View>
          );
        }

        increment = () => {
          this.setState({
            counter: counter + this.props.incrementBy
          });
        }
      }

      const styles = {
        bottomBarMargin:{
          marginBottom: 110,
        },
        background: {
          flex: 1,
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'space-around',
          backgroundColor: 'blue',
        },
      };

      export default Counter;

      ```

      Demo?
      Live code?

      # What's awesome with react(-native)

      * The `react` principles are really great

      --

      * Learn `react` once, apply in web, iOS and soon Android envs

      --

      * Great developer experience: live reload, ES6, JSX, leverage JS ecosystem

      --

      * and, the most important

      ---

      # Continuous deployment. On iOS. Yes Sire

      > But, how do you bypass Apple review process?

      Apple conditions don't allow apps to download and run code at runtime.

      --

      Unless

      --

      It's code that run in the javascript / web environment.

      --

      Because it can't really do anything harmful.

      ---

      # Meh

      You have to trust Facebook and the community to maintain `react-native` long enough.

      That is all I can see.

      ---

      # Ok, but, realistically?

      We don't have to _switch_ to react native,
      --
      we can use it in specific some places.

      --

      * Use `react-native` to learn, A/B test
      * Rewrite in Objective-C once it is stabilized
